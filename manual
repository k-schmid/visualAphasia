Keep in mind:

In rowcol mode, the number of iterations should always be an even number. 
Iteration is defined on the image level, and thus an iteration contains a 
single flash of each image. For rowcol stimulation this would mean (for 
instance) a stimulation of only the rows.
If an odd number is given, the next even number is taken!
