Please add any bugs you find to the list!

OPEN
- Text on folders positioned wrongly depending on thumbnail size

FIXED
- Images are not being shown fully
- Image grid should be scaled to fill the screen vertically or horizontally to cover as much space as possible
- In OFFLINE MODE ONLY, send marker 120 (aka "TargetMarkerStart") instead of 20 (aka "MarkerStart"). DO NOT do this in ONLINE MODE (always 20/MarkerStart in that case)
- Renderer ignores rotate/flash/scale/mask flags
